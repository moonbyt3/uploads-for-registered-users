# Uploads For Registered Users

## Key Features:

1. **File Upload Menu:** This plugin adds a user-friendly menu option within the WordPress dashboard, making it effortless for users to upload files directly to your website.

2. **Customizable File Types:** Administrators have the flexibility to define the types of files that users can upload. This ensures that only the desired file formats are accepted, enhancing security and control.

3. **File Preview:** The plugin offers a convenient file preview feature, enabling administrators to view and manage user uploads. Regular users can still preview and delete their files.
